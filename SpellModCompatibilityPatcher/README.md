# SpellModCompatibilityPatcher

Automatically merges spell (includes perks) & spell-tome records according to a customizable order. 

### Usage

1. Download this patcher using Synthesis.
2. Go to the settings tab of this patcher.
3. Add spell mods under 'Preferred Override Order' in the order of highest priority, to lowest priority. Note: It is generally inadvisable to add patches to the override order, as this can cause some funky behavior. Instead, load any other patches AFTER this patcher in your actual load order.
4. Run the patcher

Notes on Load Order: Load this patch directly under your spell mods, and before any other patches, let other patches overwrite this mod.
